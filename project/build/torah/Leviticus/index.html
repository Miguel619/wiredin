<h2>Description</h2>
<p>An Acai Bowl with fresh fruit and granola is my favorite breakfast!  It's delicious, refreshing, and hydrating!</p>
<p>I've been making smoothies for years, but making a thick smoothie using frozen Acai and turning it into an Acai bowl is something I recently discovered.</p>
<p>I don't understand why, but I always feel so hydrated after eating an Acai Bowl.</p>

<h2>Tips</h2>
<p>Use your favorite granola as a topping.  I've found that a granola with banana chips goes perfect in an Acai Bowl.</p>
<p>Fresh fruit is an idea topping during the summer months when strawberries and blueberries are in season.  During off-seasons, using granola as the only topping works well.</p>
<p>It can be tough to get the correct consistency in the blender, but add water if the mixture is too thick and isn't mixing correctly.</p>
