<h2>Tips</h2>
<p>The measurements in this recipe need to be followed exactly! I've found that changing any item can result in the cookies coming out flat.</p>
<p>For the ultimate guide to how to make different varieties of chocolate chip cookies, I highly recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCzVqaFMlIw">The Science Behind the Perfect Chocolate Chip Cookies - Kitchen Conundrums with Thomas Joseph</a>.</p>
<p>I've found the biggest factor in a great batch of cookies is making sure to take out the dairy-free butter a few hours before baking to make sure it softens to room temperature.</p>
<p>This might sound weird, but I actually think these cookies taste better the day after baking them!</p>

<h2>Recipe Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees (F).</li>
    <li>In a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, cream the dairy-free butter and both sugars for 3-4 minutes</li>
    <li>Add the eggs one at a time with mixing on low speed</li>
    <li>Add the vanilla extract, salt, baking soda, and flour</li>
    <li>Mix to combine</li>
    <li>Lastly, add the chocolate chips and mix until the chocolate chips look evenly distributed</li>
    <li>Using an ice cream scoop or small spoons, place small balls (slightly smaller than a golf ball) of dough onto a baking sheet (8-12 cookies should fit on the baking sheet)</li>
    <li>Cook for 9-10 minutes (the cookies will darken by a shade during cooling)</li>
    <li>After taking the baking sheet out of the oven, let the cookies rest for 5 minutes and then move them to a wire rack to cool</li>
</ol>
